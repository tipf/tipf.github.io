I am a research assistant at the Chair of  Automation Engineering at TU Chemnitz, specializing in the development  of robust sensor data fusion methods. My primary objective is to create  reliable algorithms capable of handling sensor data with non-Gaussian  error distributions. Leveraging my expertise in nonlinear optimization,  maximum likelihood methods, and Bayesian inference, I strive to devise  probabilistically plausible solutions that can effectively adapt to  unforeseen conditions. By enhancing the robustness of autonomous  systems, my work contributes to advancing their overall performance and  reliability.
