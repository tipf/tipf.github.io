I am a research assistant at the [Chair of Automation Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/) at the Chemnitz University of Technology, specializing in the development of robust sensor data fusion methods.
My primary goal is to develop reliable algorithms that can handle sensor data with non-Gaussian error distributions.  

Non-Gaussian errors occur almost everywhere -- when using satellite navigation, radio-based localization or vision sensors.
If we don't consider them, any autonomous system can fail dramatically.

Leveraging my expertise in nonlinear optimization, maximum likelihood methods, and Bayesian inference, I develop probabilistically plausible algorithms that can effectively adapt to unforeseen conditions.
By enhancing the robustness of autonomous systems, my work contributes to improving their overall performance and reliability.
