Just after defending my PhD, I joined the [RTLS department](https://www.siemens.com/de/de/unternehmen/standorte/kompetenzzentrum-funkortungssysteme-chemnitz.html) of Siemens AG to develop robust indoor localization systems.
This move to industry allows me to apply my experience in robust and adaptive state estimation to real-world applications.

During the wonderful time at the [Chair of Automation Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/) at the Chemnitz University of Technology, I had the opportunity to develop several approaches for robust sensor fusion. If you are interested in specific algorithms, please have a look at my publications [here](publications).

One important lesson from my time in academia is that the assumption of Gaussian measurement errors is dangerous.
Non-Gaussian errors occur almost everywhere -- when using satellite navigation, radio-based localization, or vision sensors.
If we don't account for them, any autonomous system can fail dramatically.

Leveraging my expertise in nonlinear optimization, maximum likelihood methods, and Bayesian inference, I continue develop probabilistically plausible algorithms that can effectively adapt to unforeseen conditions.
By enhancing the robustness of autonomous systems, my work contributes to improving their overall performance and reliability.
